# seqtoid-pipelines - Bioinformatics pipleine
Seqtoid-pipelines are Rust-based pipelines for metagenomics processing. The pipelines herein are built with efficiency in mind, leveraging streams, RAM, FIFO pipes amongst other techniques to process data as quickly as possible while preserving data integrity and prioritizing meaningful error messages.


The seqtoid pipelines have primarily been written by Dr. Matthew Jobin at UCSF (matt.jobin@ucsf.edu).

### Quick Setup

### System Requirements 
The pipelines have been protoyped on an M$ Macbook Pro and use in production on a large Ubuntu-based cluster node. POSIX-compatible OS's should be able to compile and run
